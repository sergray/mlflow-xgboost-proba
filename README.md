MLflow XGBoost flavour with probabilities

This package implements `mlflow_xgboost_proba` MLflow flavour, which allows to run `predict_proba` method of `xgboost` models during inference with MLflow `mlflow models serve` CLI command.

Implementation is based on [mlflow.xgboost](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/xgboost/__init__.py) module, which is copied and modified to have the wrapper with `predict_proba` method and `predict` method calling `predict_proba` by default.

The API of the module is identical to [mlflow.xgboost](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.xgboost.html), only without support of autologging.

## Getting started with your project

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:sergray/mlflow-xgboost-proba.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
